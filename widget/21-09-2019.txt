  -> defines each one of these components and their parent / child relationship in a large XML file
  -> which can be extended or overridden in your own theme or module

  -> Magento 2 parses the XML file and runs it through the layout processor
  -> which processes each XML node and reads its configuration, which it then inserts into a
  -> large multi-dimensional associative array,where each key represents a component or a group of components within.

  -> <item name="component" xsi:type="string">uiComponent</item>
    alias for the full file path of the base Knockout JS components used in the Magento checkout

  -> displayArea render each component in the HTML
  -> This refers to the getRegion command in knockoutJS which tells the KnockoutJS renderer
     where to actually place the component in the HTML.

  -> sortOrder he position of where child components are rendered is always controlled.
